v0.87.1 Giant (Pending)
-----
* Due to a change in the Linux kernel version 3.18 and the limits of the FUSE
  interface, ceph-fuse needs be mounted as root on at least some systems. See
  issues #9997, #10277, and #10542 for details.

v0.92

* The experiemental 'keyvaluestore-dev' OSD backend has been renamed
  'keyvaluestore' (for simplicity) and marked as experimental.  To
  enable this untested feature and acknowledge that you understand
  that it is untested and may destroy data, you need to add the
  following to your ceph.conf::

    enable experimental unrecoverable data corrupting featuers = keyvaluestore

* The following librados C API function calls take a 'flags' argument whose value
  is now correctly interpreted:

     rados_write_op_operate()
     rados_aio_write_op_operate()
     rados_read_op_operate()
     rados_aio_read_op_operate()

  The flags were not correctly being translated from the librados constants to the
  internal values.  Now they are.  Any code that is passing flags to these methods
  should be audited to ensure that they are using the correct LIBRADOS_OP_FLAG_*
  constants.
